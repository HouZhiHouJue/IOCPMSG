# IOCPMSG
this is a project I 'fork' from codeplex:http://ntcpmsg.codeplex.com/SourceControl/latest. This project is no longer maintained.I read through the source code for this project many times and I think it is a good , light communication framework,I love it ,this author have very good knowledge of the algorithm , the framework is very efficient ,but it is still not perfect,and I also have my own consideration of communication. so I publish it on git to upgrades and maintenance this framework.First of I modified the bottom layer communication mechanism, using IOCP model,then this will be the 0.1 version which diffrent from the authour write.
